Driver drowsiness detection is crucial for road safety. This study leverages transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs, fine-tuned to detect fatigue via facial features, eye movements, and head posture, improving accuracy and generalization in real-time. The approach offers a reliable, scalable solution to reduce accidents and save lives.
